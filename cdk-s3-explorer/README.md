- ‚úÖ **CORS Support**: Proper cross-origin configuration for web access
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS Security**: CloudFront CDN with SSL/TLS encryption
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging**: Complete CloudTrail integration

## Architecture: CloudFront + S3 + Cognito

Secure, scalable architecture with AWS best practices implemented.

### Components
- **S3 Buckets**: Encrypted, versioned storage with CORS configuration
- **Cognito User Pool**: Native AWS authentication with hosted UI and email-based login

- **S3 access denied**: Ensure identity pool role has proper S3 permissions

### Debugging Steps
1. Check browser console for CORS or authentication errors
2. Verify CloudFront distribution is deployed and accessible
3. Test S3 bucket CORS configuration with preflight requests
4. Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda function errors
5. Validate Cognito user pool settings and user status

### Monitoring
- Monitor CloudWatch logs for authentication events
- Check CloudTrail for audit trails
- Use Cognito console to view user activity

## Development

### Local Development
1. Deploy the infrastructure to get configuration values
2. Update `web-app/public/app.js` with the deployed configuration
3. Serve the web application locally for testing

### Customization
